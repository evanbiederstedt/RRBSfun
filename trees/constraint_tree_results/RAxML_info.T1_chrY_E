IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 9 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file /gpfs/commons/home/biederstedte-934/evan_projects/correct_phylo_files/total_chromY.phy.reduced

Alignment has 9 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 10540 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 96.04%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
