IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 58 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file /gpfs/commons/home/biederstedte-934/evan_projects/correct_phylo_files/total_chrom22.phy.reduced

Alignment has 58 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
